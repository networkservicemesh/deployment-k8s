# Test scaled registry-k8s

This example shows that registry-k8s can be easly scaled. NSEs can Register and Unregister themselves in any of
the registries.

## Requires

Make sure that you have completed steps from [basic](../../basic) setup.

## Run

Deploy NSE:
```bash
kubectl apply -k https://github.com/networkservicemesh/deployments-k8s/examples/features/scaled-registry?ref=5bb6afc5f5199a63e470b3552803d06f6b70cc61
```

Wait for NSE to be ready:
```bash
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready --timeout=1m pod -l app=nse-kernel -n ns-scaled-registry
```

Check registered NSE in `etcd`
```bash
kubectl get nses -A | grep nse-kernel
```

Delete current instance of registry-k8s
```bash
kubectl scale --replicas=0 deployments/registry-k8s -n nsm-system
```

Check registered NSE in `etcd` after registry-k8s instance deletion
```bash
kubectl get nses -A | grep nse-kernel
```

Deploy two new instances of registry-k8s
```bash
kubectl scale --replicas=2 deployments/registry-k8s -n nsm-system
```

Wait for the new registry-k8s instances to be ready:
```bash
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready --timeout=1m pod -l app=registry -n nsm-system
```

Delete NSE (it unregisters itself on deletion)
```bash
kubectl scale --replicas=0 deployments/nse-kernel -n ns-scaled-registry
```

Check there is no any NSEs in `etcd` after NSE unregisters itself through the new registries
```bash
kubectl get nses -A | grep -v nse-kernel
```

## Cleanup

Delete ns:
```bash
kubectl delete ns ns-scaled-registry
```
